Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder...

This is something we as people have probably heard a thousand times. And yet, we still refuse to accept it.

My name is TJ Nealy and I am here to try to answer the question of what makes beauty so beautiful? I'm not a psychologist, an anthropologist, or even a true philosopher... I'm just a guy who wants to not only understand why I think I'm ugly, but more so, why everybody else does as well.

This, is the Beauty+ Initiative.
